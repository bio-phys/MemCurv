Description
=============

This software contains a list of python scripts used to

1. Compute curvatures of discontinuous membrane systems
2. a. Fit shape profiles of membranes under PBC.
   b. Compute local curvatures of membranes under PBC.

For a detailed description of the procedure and the algorithm, we refer to [Bhaskara2019].

Overview of the Curvature software
------------------------------------

The sofware contains two Python packages:

*`Fit_shape_profile`_ provides algorithm for least squares fit of a membrane shape profile for curved surfaces under periodic boundary conditions. This package can be used independently of the 'compute_local_curvature' package.
* `Compute_local_curvature` _uses the output of the 'Fit_shape_profile' package to compute local shape operator and compute the curvature of the protein locally. 

Help
====

Please, if you have an issue with the software, open an issue here on the github repository https://github.com/bio-phys/curvature/issues .

Dependendencies and Software Requirements
=========================================

* Python 2.7
* Python packages: numpy, scipy, MDAnalysis, pandas

Installation
============
No instalation required. Directly run the Python programs if the dependecies are present.

Other options and settings
--------------------------
Depending on membrane composition, the selection of atom type constituting the mid-plane of the bilayer needs to be selected. 

In curvature computations, If protein coordinates isis provided, the local curvatue is computed at the center of mass of the protein atoms. 

Default settings

FAQs
====
Q: My curvature values have negative instead of positive values. What is going on?

A: The sign of the curvature is dictated by convention. In the Monge representation, using h(x,y) representation of the membrane profile gives the curvature of the lower leaflet of the profile. To compute curvatues along upper leaflet, as in the manuscript (Shape operator S=-S).

Q: How is the sign of the bicelle curvature decided?

A: The bicelle curvatue sign depends on the lipid flip-flop at the open edge. If more than 50 % upper leaflet lipids from the starting structure flip onto the lower leaflet, the sign of the curvarature is -ve.
